    # The mkdir -p /root/.cabal/bin line in override-build solves the
    # following error when using --prefix:
    #   https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5240#issuecomment-615196339
    #
    # The last find command is for debugging, so we can see
    # the location and contents of our build directory in the
    # Snapcraft log after building.
    #
    # The arguments passed to v1-install here are pretty critical to
    # make sure that the compiled Haskell binary is actually looking
    # in the right places for its data files when it is installed.
    #
    # We will "install" it in our final-build Snap by using the organize
    # stanza to copy all of the relevant files to the right place.
